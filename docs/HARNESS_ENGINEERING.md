# Zotero Agent Harness Engineering

This plugin follows a Codex-style split between model strategy and local
harness enforcement.

## Contract

- The model decides which Zotero context tool is needed for the current turn.
- The harness exposes tool contracts, validates arguments, executes tools, and
  enforces budget limits.
- The harness must not use local semantic keyword rules to infer user intent.
- Tool calls are structured function calls. If parsing or validation fails, the
  harness returns structured tool errors rather than guessing a replacement
  tool.
- Previous PDF context is recorded as a ledger, not replayed as source text.
- Recent small context can be retained under policy budget so continuation turns
  can work without re-searching.
- Full PDF text is attached only for the current turn and is not replayed from
  history.
- Tool traces should be visible in the chat UI and Markdown export.

## Permission Mode

- `default`: read-only tools run directly; tools marked `requiresApproval` are
  blocked with a structured tool error until an approval UI is added.
- `yolo`: tools marked `requiresApproval` run without asking. This mirrors the
  "bypass approvals" style used by coding agents and is intended for trusted
  local workflows.

PDF modification tools such as annotation creation are marked
`requiresApproval`. Until an approval UI exists, they are blocked in `default`
mode and run only in `yolo` mode. Read tools remain available without YOLO.

## Local Context Tools

- `none`: attach no new Zotero/PDF context.
- `metadata_only`: rely on title, authors, year, tags, and abstract already
  available in the system prompt.
- `annotations`: attach Zotero PDF annotations, highlights, comments, page
  labels, and colors.
- `search_pdf`: search current PDF full-text cache with the model-provided
  query; bounded candidate passages are returned with character ranges.
- `pdf_range`: attach an exact full-text-cache character range. The model must
  provide `rangeStart` and `rangeEnd`; the harness does not infer chapter
  boundaries.
- `full_pdf`: attach current PDF full-text cache when the model explicitly
  requests whole-paper context through the tool loop.
- `equation`: attach one numbered arXiv LaTeX equation resolved through the
  local equation index, so requests like "公式 3" do not rely on nearby-section
  guessing.
- `figure`: attach one numbered arXiv figure resolved through the local figure
  index, with a raster source image when available or a PDF Reader crop
  fallback for vector figures.
- `reader_pdf_text`: attach text from the active Zotero Reader/PDF.js text
  layer for PDF write workflows. Passages copied from this source can be
  located by `zotero_annotate_passage`.
- `annotation_write`: records permission-aware write tools such as
  `zotero_annotate_passage`. These tools must be visible in traces and blocked
  unless the permission mode allows writes.

Selected PDF text is explicit UI context, not an inferred semantic intent. When
present, it is attached directly to the current user message and recorded as
`selected_text` in the visible trace.

## GitHub Network Diagram Loop

The network-diagram workspace uses an independent model conversation while
reusing the selected model preset. Its read-only harness follows the same
model-driven rule as Zotero context retrieval:

- the harness fixes a public `github.com/{owner}/{repo}` repository to one
  commit SHA and obtains its complete file tree;
- `github_list_paths` lets the model inspect real candidate paths;
- `github_read_files` lets the model choose exact paths, symbols or line ranges,
  a selection reason, and the missing diagram-detail category each read covers;
- every requested path must be a blob in the fixed commit tree, and raw content
  is read through the fixed SHA rather than a moving branch;
- there is no file-count completion rule. Aggregate text, request, tool-loop and
  time budgets are safety fuses; the eight structured detail categories decide
  whether the candidate is complete;
- `submit_network_diagram` validates evidence IDs, required stages, a continuous
  input-to-output path and category coverage before the candidate can replace
  the current graph. Rejected candidates remain inside the tool loop and never
  create a revision;
- this is static source analysis, not runtime tracing. Repository code is never
  executed and dependency/install scripts are never run.

Repository source bodies are transient tool output. Sync stores only the fixed
repository reference, graph revisions, independent conversation and evidence
pointers, so WebDAV never becomes a source-code mirror.

## Policy

All size and count limits live in `src/context/policy.ts`. Runtime logic should
not contain scattered magic numbers for context budgets. If a new Zotero tool
needs a limit, add it to `ContextPolicy` and pass the policy into the tool.

Codex's official turn loop does not use a semantic `max_iterations` table. It
keeps sampling while model output needs a follow-up, usually because a tool call
was emitted, and it relies on cancellation, token budgets, compaction, and tool
execution limits. In the reference code this is driven by `needs_follow_up` in
`codex-rs/core/src/session/turn.rs`, and tool calls set that flag in
`codex-rs/core/src/stream_events_utils.rs`. This plugin mirrors that shape with
`maxToolIterations` as a large safety fuse, currently `100`, not as task-type
routing logic.

## Prompt Assembly

Each turn is assembled from:

1. system prompt with current item metadata;
2. previous context ledger, explicitly marked as not currently attached;
3. chat text history without old full-PDF blocks;
4. recent small context retained within policy budget;
5. current user message with explicit selected text, if any;
6. local tool calls and tool outputs produced during the model-driven loop.

This prevents accidental re-sending of old full PDFs while still giving the
model enough state to request the smallest necessary local context again.

## Codex Design Parallels

- Codex lets the model request tools; the local side routes, validates, executes,
  truncates, and returns tool output.
- Codex does not decide semantic intent with local keyword matching.
- Codex continues the turn while `needs_follow_up` is true after tool calls; it
  does not have a fixed user-intent iteration table.
- Codex compacts or truncates history under context pressure; this plugin keeps a
  lightweight ledger and retains only small recent context under explicit policy.
- Tool availability and output size are harness responsibilities; content choice
  is a model responsibility.

## Zotero-Specific Guardrails

- Treat annotations as first-class context because they represent user-created
  reading state.
- Do not write Zotero notes or annotations unless the user explicitly asks.
- For PDF highlights selected by the model, read from `reader_pdf_text` before
  writing; do not copy highlight passages from the full-text cache, because its
  text can differ from the Reader text layer used for coordinates.
- Markdown summary generation should be a separate write tool with explicit
  confirmation and a visible destination.
- If exact PDF content is unavailable, say which tool/context is missing rather
  than guessing.
