# Release Flow

This project releases XPI files from Git tags. The local machine only commits and pushes a tag; GitHub Actions builds and publishes the XPI asset.

## One-time setup

Add a GitHub remote if the repository does not have one yet:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
```

If you choose another repository, update `package.json` first so the package metadata points at the same GitHub repo.

Push the main branch once:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Normal release

First update and commit the version, for example via `/auto-commit`. Then run one
command:

```bash
npm run release:xpi
```

The script reads `package.json` version and releases `v<version>`. You can also
pass the expected tag explicitly:

```bash
npm run release:xpi -- v0.1.2
```

The script verifies the working tree is clean, runs tests, builds the XPI locally,
creates the annotated tag if needed, pushes the current branch, pushes the tag,
waits for GitHub Actions, and prints the final release asset URL.

## Republish an existing tag

If the GitHub Release was deleted but the tag still exists, recreate the release without moving the tag:

```bash
npm run release:xpi -- v0.1.2 --republish
```

## Lower-level tag-only command

If you already bumped and committed the version manually, use:

```bash
npm run release:tag -- v0.1.2
```

This lower-level script checks that the working tree is clean, verifies the tag matches `package.json` version, creates an annotated tag if needed, pushes the current branch, and pushes the tag.

When the tag reaches GitHub, `.github/workflows/release.yml` automatically runs:

- `npm ci`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- uploads `.scaffold/build/*.xpi` to the version release
- publishes `update.json` / `update-beta.json` to the fixed `release` Release (auto-update)

## Manual release from GitHub UI

The same workflow also supports `workflow_dispatch`. Run **Release XPI** in GitHub Actions, enter a tag like `v0.1.2`, and the workflow will create the tag if needed, build the XPI, and publish the release.

## Notes

- Do not commit local XPI build artifacts. `*.xpi` is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Each release also publishes `update.json` / `update-beta.json` to a fixed `release` Release (the plugin's `update_url` target) for Zotero auto-update. Do not delete that `release` Release.
- Local provider configuration such as API keys, Base URL, and model IDs stays in Zotero prefs, not source code.
- Release tags should start with `v`, for example `v0.1.0`.
